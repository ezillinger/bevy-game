## Welcome to my amazing game

This is a quick and dirty roguelike shooter game I made to mess around with Rust and Bevy. I had never used Rust before this.

The only notable feature is the HDR bloom effect. It's not very fun and it's riddled with bugs.

Whatever I used to encode this gif screwed up the framerate. It runs much faster than this.
